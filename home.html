                            Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (12 November 1648 – 17 April 1695) was a Mexican writer,
                            philosopher, composer, poet of the Baroque period, and Hieronymite nun. Her outspoken
                            opinions
                            granted her lifelong names such as "The Tenth Muse" and "The Phoenix of Mexico", for she was
                            a
                            flame
                            that rose from the ashes of "religious authoritarianism".


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Sor Juana lived during Mexico's colonial period, making her a contributor both to early
                            Spanish
                            literature as well as to the broader literature of the Spanish Golden Age. Beginning her
                            studies
                            at
                            a young age, Sor Juana was fluent in Latin and also wrote in Nahuatl, and became known for
                            her
                            philosophy in her teens. Sor Juana educated herself in her own library
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After joining a nunnery in 1667,[3] Sor Juana began writing poetry and prose dealing with
                            such
                            topics as love, feminism, and religion.[4] She turned her nun's quarters into a salon,
                            visited
                            by the city's intellectual elite. Among them was Countess Maria Luisa de Paredes, Vicereine
                            of
                            Mexico.[5]

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Her criticism of misogyny and the hypocrisy of men led to her condemnation by the Bishop of
                            Puebla, and in 1694 she was forced to sell her collection of books and focus on charity
                            towards
                            the poor. She died the next year, having caught the plague while treating her sisters.

                        </p>

                        <p>Scholars now interpret Sor Juana as a protofeminist, and she is the subject of vibrant
                            discourses
                            about themes such as colonialism, education rights, women's religious authority, and writing
                            as
                            examples of feminist advocacy.</p>
